## :clipboard: Summary
The main objective of this project was to predict the default EMI payments of customers belonging to an Indonesian telecom company.

The dataset contains 209593 rows and 37 columns.

The project was completed in 5 major steps:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Data Transformation
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Data Preparation
5. Model Building and Model Tuning

Engineered features such as customer group, and average amount per loan. 

A Random Forest Classifier model was built to predict default EMI payments. The model was evaluated using a recall metric to reduce false negatives. A Recall score of 92% was acheived.
