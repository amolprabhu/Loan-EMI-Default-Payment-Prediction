## ðŸ“‹ Summary
The main objective of this project was to predict the default EMI payments of customers belonging to an Indonesian telecom company.

The dataset contains 209593 rows and 37 columns.

The project was completed in 5 major steps:
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Data Transformation
5. Model Building and Tuning

Engineered features such as customer group, average amount per loan, average recharge amount and total recharge frequency. 

A Random Forest Classifier model was built and tuned using Randomized Search CV to predict default EMI payments. The model was evaluated using a recall metric to reduce false negatives. A Recall score of 90% was acheived.
